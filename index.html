        <section id="Introduction">
			<pr>Energy is a factor which determine a countryâ€™s economy, transportation, and standard of life. The problem faced globally is the consumption and the availability of energy. <br>
There are two main problems of continuous using of fossil fuels - 
        1) Limited amount of fossil fuel.
        2) Cause due to fossil fuel to environment such as Global Warming, Acid Rain, Pollution, etc.<br>
To supply more amount of energy for increasing population, alternative is to use electricity for vehicles.<br>
It is the cleanest and efficient fuel.<br>
The alternative to fossil fuels represented by other energy sources such as: battery systems, ultracapacitors or fuel cells.<br>
FCEVs can reduce emission to some extent but not to zero.<br>
Thus, the renewable energy transport allows FCEVs to become preferable choice.<br>
